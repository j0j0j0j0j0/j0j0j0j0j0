Actually, the Soviet Union ended at 11:40 PM, not 11:40 AM. Lol. I saw that you didn't reply for an hour and I think I know why. Lol. It's because you saw me, a HISTORY buff, put a comment to correct you. To save you all the boring details, you can already tell I am a history buff by the subscriptions I have on my Youtube account: "Comrade Stalin". Lol. You will see that I am subscribed to various HISTORICAL Youtube channels, two of my favourites being 'Simple History' and 'Oversimplified' I like these accounts for how engaging they are, particularly through the usage of dank memes. I really like these dank memes because it shows HISTORICAL events in a humorous way, such as, The Second World War (probably the topic I know the most about). I think you are starting to see where I am going, lol...my favourite dank memes are countryballs (or polandball lol), I enjoy watching countryball videos on Youtube then looking at the comments to correct any historical inaccuracies, because I'm a history buff they all realise that I know what I'm talking about because I'm a history buff.

  Something else which definitely shows my HISTORICAL finesse is my music taste, I listen to classical music such as Bach and Mozart 10 hour compilation(s). But, my favourite composer is Tchaikovsky (not sure if you've heard of him). He's from this country called Russia (not sure if you've heard of it). I think Russia is a very pleasant country (probably the most pleasant in the world) and by far the best military wise (which is basically all that matters, because it can beat ANY country in a war.) But, personally, I think Russia's golden age ended in 1991 when Communism ended there. I can name EVERY SINGLE piece of Soviet (WW2) weapon (like tanks and guns), and every Soviet leader in order since I'm a history buff! I'm currently learning Russian and I can't wait to finally go. I plan to live there one day.
  
  I know what you're thinking, how can I possibly have such an extraordinary and intellectual mind such as this? Haha, I know, but the answer is simple: I am a history buff.
  
  The other thing I'm really into (other than WW2) is Celtic Mythology and Paganism. (I'm not Celtic in any way shape or form) but I really think all Celtic areas should form one country and fight the West (even though I'm from the West) because they run a cruel capitalist regime. You probably realise now that I seriously know my stuff and it's not even worth replying to this comment because I'm a history buff.
